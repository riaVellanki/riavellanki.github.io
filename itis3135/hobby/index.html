        <p>Badminton is a racket sport that is played either as singles (one player per side) or doubles (two players per side). It is played indoors on a rectangular court divided by a net. The game involves players using racquets to hit a shuttlecock (also known as a birdie) back and forth over the net. The objective is to score points by landing the shuttlecock in the opponent's side of the court in a way that it cannot be returned properly.</p>
        <p>Badminton requires agility, speed, and accuracy, making it a physically demanding sport. It is popular worldwide, particularly in Asia and Europe, and is an Olympic sport.

    <section id="who">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>When I was twelve years old, I stumbled upon badminton purely for the joy of it. Little did I know, that moment would mark the beginning of a lifelong love affair with the sport. What started as a casual pastime soon transformed into a passion that endured through the years. From the thrill of those early matches with friends to the more competitive games as I grew older, badminton became an integral part of my life.</p>
        <p>It wasn't just about the exercise or the competition; it was about the camaraderie, the strategy, and the sheer exhilaration of every rally. As I navigated through the different stages of my life, from school to college and beyond, badminton remained a constant, offering solace in times of stress and jubilation in moments of triumph. Through the highs and lows, the wins and losses, one thing remained unchanged â€“ my unwavering dedication to the graceful yet demanding sport of badminton.</p>

    <section id="when">
        <h2>Best Times</h2>
        <p>The best time to play badminton often depends on personal preference, as well as factors such as weather, availability of facilities, and schedule constraints. However, many people find that playing badminton during the cooler parts of the day, such as early morning or late evening, can be more comfortable and enjoyable, especially if playing outdoors. Indoor courts provide more flexibility in terms of timing, as they are not affected by weather conditions.</p>
        <p>In terms of scheduling, weekends or evenings after work or school are popular times for playing badminton, as they allow for more leisure time and relaxation. However, if you prefer quieter courts and less crowded facilities, weekdays during off-peak hours might be preferable.

            Ultimately, the best time to play badminton is when you feel energized, motivated, and able to fully enjoy the game. Whether it's a morning session to kickstart your day or an evening game to unwind after work, the most important thing is to find a time that suits your schedule and allows you to fully engage in the sport.</p>
